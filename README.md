# PF4PBF
# Post Fire Residual Capacity (ISO 834 Fire exposure Analysis for Cross-Section Beam)

## Overview

This repository contains an Abaqus Python script for analyzing cross-section beams under the ISO 834 standard fire. The script allows users to input various parameters such as beam dimensions, tie bar details, fire exposure duration, span, support distance, longitudinal bar diameter, mesh size, etc., to perform the analysis.

## Features

- Analyzes cross-section beams under ISO 834 standard fire conditions.
- Allows customization of beam parameters including depth, width, tie bar size, tie bar spacing, cover size, fire exposure duration, span, support distance, longitudinal bar diameter, and mesh size.
- Provides detailed output including stress analysis, deflection, and other relevant results.
